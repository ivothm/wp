What is this highly valuable asset? Its own people. Says Morgan Fraud, the author of The Thinking Corporation, “Given that we are all capable of contributing new ideas, the question becomes how do you successfully generate, capture, process and implement ideas?” Becoming an organization capable of answering this question can benefit in a number of ways:[/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner css=".vc_custom_1452700243026{margin-bottom: 39px !important;}"][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]
<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Growth through innovation/creativity:</strong>
<span style="font-size: 13px;">Rather than be constrained by ideas for new products, services and new markets coming from just a few people, a Thinking Corporation can tap into the employees.</span></li>
	<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Increased profits:</strong>
<span style="font-size: 13px;">The corporation will experience an increase in profits due to savings in operating costs as well as sales from new products, services and ventures.</span></li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]
<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Higher business values:</strong>
<span style="font-size: 13px;">The link between profits and business value means that the moment a corporation creates a new sustainable level of profit, the business value is adjusted accordingly.</span></li>
	<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Lower staff turnover:</strong>
<span style="font-size: 13px;">This, combined with the culture that must exist for innovation and creativity to flourish, means that new employees will be attracted to the organization.</span></li>
</ul>
